# Average Plotting Examples

This folder contains R scripts that demonstrate basic plotting techniques using the `ggplot2` package. The scripts are designed to introduce users to fundamental concepts in data visualization, including creating and saving plots, as well as rendering plots in a web browser for interactive exploration.

## Files in This Folder

### 1. `basicPlots.R`

This script demonstrates how to create and save a simple histogram plot in R using the `ggplot2` package.

#### What You Will Learn:

- **Data Loading**: How to load and work with the built-in `iris` dataset in R.
- **Calculating Averages**: How to calculate the mean of a specific column in a dataset.
- **Basic Plotting**: How to create a histogram to visualize the distribution of a numerical variable.
- **Saving Plots**: How to save plots as PNG files for use in reports or presentations.

#### How to Run:

1. Ensure you have the `ggplot2` package installed:

   ```r
   install.packages("ggplot2")
   ```

Run the script in R or RStudio. The histogram plot will be saved as iris_histogram.png in your working directory (typically the Downloads folder).

2. avgPlot_webBrowsingVersion.R

This script introduces the httpgd package, which allows you to render plots directly in a web browser. It demonstrates creating a scatter plot using ggplot2, which is automatically displayed in your browser.
What You Will Learn:

    Web-Based Plotting: How to use httpgd to view plots in a web browser, enabling interactive exploration.
    Data Loading: Working with the iris dataset.
    Scatter Plotting: How to create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between two variables.
    Interactive Visualization: Explore how web-based graphics can enhance data analysis.

How to Run:

    Install the httpgd and ggplot2 packages if you haven't already:

    ```r
    install.packages(c("httpgd", "ggplot2"))
    ```

Run the script in R or RStudio. The plot will be rendered in your default web browser.

Learning Objectives

By working through these scripts, you will:

    Gain hands-on experience with the ggplot2 package for creating basic plots.
    Learn how to calculate summary statistics, such as the mean, and use them in visualizations.
    Understand how to save plots to your local machine for later use.
    Discover the advantages of web-based graphics for interactive data exploration using httpgd.

How to Use

    Run the Scripts: Execute each script in R or RStudio. Follow the instructions provided in the comments to understand the functionality.
    Explore the Output: Examine the plots generated by each script to see how different visualization techniques are applied.
    Adapt and Reuse: Feel free to modify the scripts for your own datasets and visualization needs.
